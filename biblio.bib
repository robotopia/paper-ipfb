abstract = {Studying the gravitational-wave sky with pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) is a key science goal for the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) and its pathfinder telescopes. With current PTAs reaching sub-microsecond timing precision, making accurate measurements of interstellar propagation effects and mitigating them effectively has become increasingly important to realise PTA goals. As these effects are much stronger at longer wavelengths, low-frequency observations are most appealing for characterizing the interstellar medium (ISM) along the sight lines toward PTA pulsars. The Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) and the Engineering Development Array (EDA), which utilizes MWA technologies, present promising opportunities for undertaking such studies, particularly for PTA pulsars located in the southern sky. Such pulsars are also the prime targets for PTA efforts planned with the South African MeerKAT, and eventually with the SKA. In this paper we report on observations of two bright southern millisecond pulsars PSRs J0437-4715 and J2145-0750 made with these facilities; MWA observations sampling multiple frequencies across the 80-250 MHz frequency range, while the EDA providing direct-sampled baseband data to yield a large instantaneous usable bandwidth of {\$}\backslashsim{\$}200 MHz. Using these observations, we investigate various aspects relating to pulsar emission and ISM properties, such as spectral evolution of the mean pulse shape, scintillation as a function of frequency, chromaticity in interstellar dispersion, and flux density spectra at low frequencies. Systematic and regular monitoring observations will help ascertain the role of low-frequency measurements in PTA experiments, while simultaneously providing a detailed characterization of the ISM toward the pulsars, which will be useful in devising optimal observing strategies for future PTA experiments.},

abstract = {A discussion is made of those observations that place constraints on the pulsar emission mechanism and its location in the pulsar magnetosphere. After reviewing the salient features of pulsar radiation, a number of issues are confronted, including (1) whether coherence is broadband or narrowband and, accordingly, (2) whether the emission frequency is mapped into radius and/or magnetic polar angle; and (3) whether pulse structure (micropulses and subpulses) represents angular or temporal structure. It is proposed that pulse nulling, mode changing, and quantized drift rates for subpulses are related to discrete states of the particle flow in polar cap models.},

abstract = {The technique of polyphase filterbanks is commonly used for signal processing in radio astronomy. The rapid and ongoing evolution of parallel hardware architectures requires optimised implementations of such techniques to be redeveloped. However, much of the published research regarding polyphase filterbanks refers the reader to signal processing books with a more general scope. Furthermore, these references tend to focus on the design of filters, rather than their implementation. For this reason, this work presents a mathematical background for the implementation of a polyphase filterbank specific to radio astronomy. It also addresses the advantages and disadvantages of polyphase filterbanks in comparison with more commonly used techniques.},

@article{Hessels2019,
abstract = {FRB 121102 is the only known repeating fast radio burst source. Here we analyze a wide-frequency-range (1–8 GHz) sample of high signal-to-noise, coherently dedispersed bursts detected using the Arecibo and Green Bank telescopes. These bursts reveal complex time–frequency structures that include subbursts with finite bandwidths. The frequency-dependent burst structure complicates the determination of a dispersion measure (DM); we argue that it is appropriate to use a DM metric that maximizes frequency-averaged pulse structure, as opposed to peak signal-to-noise, and find DM = 560.57 ± 0.07 pc cm−3 at MJD 57,644. After correcting for dispersive delay, we find that the subbursts have characteristic frequencies that typically drift lower at later times in the total burst envelope. In the 1.1–1.7 GHz band, the ∼0.5–1 ms subbursts have typical bandwidths ranging from 100 to 400 MHz, and a characteristic drift rate of ∼200 MHz ms−1 toward lower frequencies. At higher radio frequencies, the subburst bandwidths and drift rate are larger, on average. While these features could be intrinsic to the burst emission mechanism, they could also be imparted by propagation effects in the medium local to the source. Comparison of the burst DMs with previous values in the literature suggests an increase of $\Delta$DM ∼ 1–3 pc cm−3 in 4 yr; though, this could be a stochastic variation as opposed to a secular trend. This implies changes in the local medium or an additional source of frequency-dependent delay. Overall, the results are consistent with previously proposed scenarios in which FRB 121102 is embedded in a dense nebula.},

abstract = {We report observations of the microstructure of 7 pulsars at 102 MHz with a time resolution of up to 1 $\mu$s. We have detected fine pulse structure with a $\mu$s time-scale for all seven pulsars. We observe that interstellar scattering does not broaden the $\mu$s time-scale pulsar microstructure, and find structure of a time-scale much shorter than the interstellar scatter broadening. In addition to the previously known structure with time-scale $\tau$$\mu$ of tens of $\mu$s, we have detected structures with characteristic time-scale of a few $\mu$s, nearly equal to the reciprocal of the analysis bandwidth. This suggests that even shorter micropulses may exist.Micropulses usually cluster in groups, each of duration tens to hundreds of $\mu$s, which may be identified as microstructure observed previously with smaller time resolution.In addition to the previously known quasi-periodicity of hundreds of milliseconds, we reveal a structures with characteristic period of tens of $\mu$s. We observe structures with short quasi-periodicity to have a limited bandwidth. The characteristic period P$\mu$ of these structures in PSR B0950+08 does not have a common value for different frequency regions in the same single pulse.Scattering was revealed as a train of quasi-periodic micropulses with an exponentially damped envelope. The scatter-broadening and decorrelation bandwidth were measured. We report two time-scales of decorrelation bandwidth of pulsar PSR B0950+08 and propose two branches of $\Delta$$\nu$d($\nu$) dependence.The dispersion measure of PSR B0950+08 as DM= 2.9686 ± 0.0001 pc cm−3 has been determined.},

Here, we report on new observations of PSR J0034‑0721 (B0031‑07) carried out with the Murchison Widefield Array at 185 {\{}MHz{\}}. We observe three distinct drift modes whose “vertical” drift band separations (P3) and relative abundances are consistent with previous studies at similar and higher frequencies. The drift bands, however, are observed to change their slopes over the course of individual drift modes, which can be interpreted as a continuously changing drift rate. The implied acceleration of the intrinsic carousel rotation cannot easily be explained by plasma models based on E×B drift. Furthermore, we find that methods of classifying the drift modes by means of P3 measurements can sometimes produce erroneous identifications in the presence of a changing drift rate. The “horizontal” separation between drift bands (P2) is found to be larger at later rotation phases within the pulse window, which is inconsistent with the established effects of retardation, aberration, and the motion of the visible point. Longer observations spanning at least ∼10,000 pulses are required to determine how the carousel rotation parameters change from one drift sequence to the next.},

abstract = {We report on observations of giant pulses from the Crab pulsar performed simultaneously with the Parkes radio telescope and the incoherent combination of the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) antenna tiles. The observations were performed over a duration of approximately one hour at a center frequency of 1382 MHz with 340 MHz bandwidth at Parkes, and at a center frequency of 193 MHz with 15 MHz bandwidth at the MWA. Our analysis has led to the detection of 55 giant pulses at the MWA and 2075 at Parkes above a threshold of 3.5$\sigma$ and 6.5$\sigma$, respectively. We detected 51{\%} of the MWA giant pulses at the Parkes radio telescope, with spectral indices in the range of -3.6$\backslash$gt $\alpha$ $\backslash$gt -4.9 ({\{}S{\}}$\nu$ $\backslash$propto {\{}$\nu$ {\}}$\alpha$ ). We present a Monte Carlo analysis supporting the conjecture that the giant pulse emission in the Crab is intrinsically broadband, the less than 100{\%} correlation being due to the relative sensitivities of the two instruments and the width of the spectral index distribution. Our observations are consistent with the hypothesis that the spectral index of giant pulses is drawn from normal distribution of standard deviation 0.6, but with a mean that displays an evolution with frequency from -3.00 at 1382 MHz, to -2.85 at 192 MHz.},

@article{Prabu2015,
abstract = {An FPGA-based digital-receiver has been developed for a low-frequency imaging radio interferometer, the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA). The MWA, located at the Murchison Radio-astronomy Observatory (MRO) in Western Australia, consists of 128 dual-polarized aperture-array elements (tiles) operating between 80 and 300$\backslash$,MHz, with a total processed bandwidth of 30.72 MHz for each polarization. Radio-frequency signals from the tiles are amplified and band limited using analog signal conditioning units; sampled and channelized by digital-receivers. The signals from eight tiles are processed by a single digital-receiver, thus requiring 16 digital-receivers for the MWA. The main function of the digital-receivers is to digitize the broad-band signals from each tile, channelize them to form the sky-band, and transport it through optical fibers to a centrally located correlator for further processing. The digital-receiver firmware also implements functions to measure the signal power, perform power equalization across the band, detect interference-like events, and invoke diagnostic modes. The digital-receiver is controlled by high-level programs running on a single-board-computer. This paper presents the digital-receiver design, implementation, current status, and plans for future enhancements.},

abstract = {The Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) is one of three Square Kilometre Array Precursor telescopes and is located at the Murchison Radio-astronomy Observatory in the Murchison Shire of the mid-west of Western Australia, a location chosen for its extremely low levels of radio frequency interference. The MWA operates at low radio frequencies, 80-300 MHz, with a processed bandwidth of 30.72 MHz for both linear polarisations, and consists of 128 aperture arrays (known as tiles) distributed over a {\~{}}3-km diameter area. Novel hybrid hardware/software correlation and a real-time imaging and calibration systems comprise the MWA signal processing backend. In this paper, the as-built MWA is described both at a system and sub-system level, the expected performance of the array is presented, and the science goals of the instrument are summarised.},

@article{Tremblay2015,
abstract = {The science cases for incorporating high time resolution capabilities into modern radio telescopes are as numerous as they are compelling. Science targets range from exotic sources such as pulsars, to our Sun, to recently detected possible extragalactic bursts of radio emission, the so-called fast radio bursts (FRBs). Originally conceived purely as an imaging telescope, the initial design of the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) did not include the ability to access high time and frequency resolution voltage data. However, the flexibility of the MWA's software correlator allowed an off-the-shelf solution for adding this capability. This paper describes the system that records the 100 mus and 10 kHz resolution voltage data from the MWA. Example science applications, where this capability is critical, are presented, as well as accompanying commissioning results from this mode to demonstrate verification.},
