====== Quantisation effects ======
Created Tuesday 12 May 2020

Given that we know that the original coarse channel data were quantised, under what circumstances does quantising our final answer help us out?

We assume that our errors are normally distributed about zero, e.g.

{{~/work/pfb-testing/B0950+08/rec/single/correlated_histogram_mirror_res10.png?width=640}}

Then the variance is just the second moment:
{{./equation.png?type=equation}}
However, if we quantise the errors, we get:
{{./equation001.png?type=equation}}

A comparison between the original standard deviation and the quantised deviation reveals:
{{~/work/pfb-testing/B0950+08/rec/single/quant_histogram.png?width=640}}

The black dashed line is the "y=x" line, the red dotted line marks the approximate standard deviation using the mirror filter (~0.60), and the blue is with the 12-tap least-squares filter (~0.57). Neither is anywhere near the point where it becomes beneficial to use quantisation, which is about 0.29.
