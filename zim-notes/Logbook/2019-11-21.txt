I //finally// have a smidge of time to try and figure this forward PFB out.

I just finished re-vamping the forward_pfb program so that it generates data in the same format as the recombined files (git commit 896363f). I now have a full pipeline that I can use for testing my forward (synthesis) PFB against my (known-to-work) backwards (analysis) PFB.

So, to get started, I will try and put some fake data containing a sinusoid through the forward pfb and see what the spectrum looks like! I altered read_after so that it spits out a matrix of the absolute values (i.e. the amplitude of the dynamic spectrum), so the following uses git commit 86cc60e.

    Altered read_after so that it writes out the absolute values, instead of the real and imaginary components separately.
