My plan has been to create a forward PFB model, run the coarse channel data through it, and compare the output with the recombined output data. As mentioned many times above, the trouble has been not being sure which ‘raw’ data lines up with which ‘recombined’ data, because the data are ordered differently in each case. Despite my best efforts so far, I haven’t been able to find a match.

However, I’ve just discovered that one of the broken antennas (“ant9” in Fig. 1) is not completely broken. That is to say, the raw data files are not completely made up of zeros. There is the occasional non-zero byte (usually 1 or −1), and I think I might be able to leverage that if this non-zero value went through the fine PFB.

The first non-zero value I found in ant 9 of Rec01 1213668800.raw is located at byte 0xdbb2, which, according to Brian’s notes, should correspond to the 219th sample, 5th channel (all numbers here are 0-offset).
