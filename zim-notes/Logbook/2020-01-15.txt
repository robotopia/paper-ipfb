After downloading the recombined files of obsid 1260302416, I found that a (for me) familiar error has occurred and untar has failed on several files, including the time span I'm interested in (explicitly, from ''1260302416_1260302482_combined.tar'' to ''1260302416_1260302929_combined.tar''). This range seems to correspond to a filaure of the batch files (in ''/group/mwaops/vcs/1260302416/batch''):
{{{code: lang="sh" linenumbers="False"
check_volt_1260302482.batch
check_volt_1260302546.batch
check_volt_1260302610.batch

check_volt_1260302738.batch
check_volt_1260302802.batch
check_volt_1260302866.batch
}}}

The other (three?) check_volt scripts seemed to work just fine. Well, I can't be bothered troubleshooting this, so I'll just get Nick to fire off the jobs again and be done with it.

--------------------

I need an apples-to-apples comparison of the HTR data and the resynthesised data set. The trouble is, the latter is necessarily beamformed already, so I'd have to beamform the HTR data without fine-PFB'ing it. If I want to use exactly the same pipeline, I'd have to recast the HTR data into the recombined data format, put it through the beamformer, and then reconstruct the (HTR) timeseries.

Although technically possible, I can't do it both easily and efficiently.

The current beamforming pipeline makes you choose between producing an incoherent sum //or// inverse-PFB. You can't have both.

Weighing everything up, I think the only viable solution is to do the comparison with the incoherent sum. I just realised I //can// avoid the beamforming issue by using my branch of the beamformer that picks out a single antenna instead of beamforming. If I do that for each antenna, I'll have a directly comparable set of HTR voltages. I can then fold each data set in the same way to get a folded profile which I can then directly compare. I'll also have a "noise" timeseries which has only been forward- and backward-PFB'ed. Finally, I can produce the full coherently dedispersed profile for the wow factor (assuming there is one).

Downloading the relevant recombined files:

--------------------

Switching tracks for a moment, I just wrote a program for (incoherently summing and) folding HTR data at a given pulsar period.

I should now be able to re-create the kind of single-pulse data that Brian was producing. If I set the period to be the whole time, I can choose the number of bins as an effective time-scrunching factor. There are 80 seconds worth of data here, so if I choose 6,400,000 bins, I should get out the same time resolution as I would for fine-PFB'ed data:

80*200*51200/6400000 = a scrunching factor of 128
