The previous attempt to do this...
{{{code: lang="sh" linenumbers="False"
galaxy> process_vcs.py -m download_cal -O 1260271200 -o 1260302416
}}}

...bombed out with an out of time error. I didn't follow that up, and simply tried again this morning, after Pawsey's upgrade over the holiday break. I got an sbatch error saying:
{{{code: lang="sh" linenumbers="False"

I emailed Pawsey's help desk:

Hi Pawsey,

I just tried using one of our standard scripts for downloading data to be used on Zeus:
/group/mwaops/vcs/1260302416/batch/caldownload_1260271200.batch

I get the error message:
sbatch: error: Batch job submission failed: Invalid account or account/partition combination specified

Is the mwaops group no longer set up to use Zeus?

Cheers,
~/Sam

Hi Sam

I just had a look at the associations of accounts on slurm with regards to "mwaops"

From the looks of it, the only allowed currently is mwaops on galaxy.

On the portal application mwaops has both access to galaxy and zeus.

Looks like it was a byproduct of account cleanup on magnus and zeus.

Although it was listed on the portal, the accounts needs to be re-activated on zeus after the purge (Galaxy was left untouched)

I've re-activted your account and I'll loop though the other members of mwaops.

Cheers then, Ashley

So that fixed that issue. But actually, the ASVO data server is down still, so I won't be able to download the data just yet anyway.
