My impulse response test is rubbish. So, I'm going to have to figure out exactly what's going wrong â€” whether it's the rounding errors or the imperfectness of my forward PFB that's causing me grief.

First of all, I'd better document my impulse response test.

==== Theoretical impulse response for least squares filter with 12 taps ====

In the paper git repo (on the work desktop, [[~/documents/papers/ipfb]]; on the home desktop, [[~/work/papers/ipfb]]), running
{{{code: lang="sh" linenumbers="False"

python find_inverse.py

}}}

produces, among other things, the files
{{{code: lang="sh" linenumbers="False"
impulse_response_*.txt
}}}

which contain the theoretical impulse response of the various filters that are considered (mirror filter, and least squares filters with 12, 18, and 24 taps).
