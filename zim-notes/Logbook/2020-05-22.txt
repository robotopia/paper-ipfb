My impulse response test is rubbish. So, I'm going to have to figure out exactly what's going wrong â€” whether it's the rounding errors or the imperfectness of my forward PFB that's causing me grief.

First of all, I'd better document my impulse response test.

==== Theoretical impulse response for least squares filter with 12 taps ====

In the paper git repo (on the work desktop, [[~/documents/papers/ipfb]]; on the home desktop, [[~/work/papers/ipfb]]), running
{{{code: lang="sh" linenumbers="False"
# Go to the repo directory and checkout the appropriate version
cd ~/documents/papers/ipfb
# or
cd ~/work/papers/ipfb

git checkout 7b04401

# Run the script
python find_inverse.py

}}}

produces, among other things, the files
{{{code: lang="sh" linenumbers="False"
impulse_response_*.txt
}}}

which contain the theoretical impulse response of the various filters that are considered (mirror filter, and least squares filters with 12, 18, and 24 taps).

Then, before running the impulse response test, make sure to checkout the following version of vcstools:
{{{code: lang="sh" linenumbers="False"
cd ~/src/vcstools
git checkout e468088
# ... and then see Scripts and Code:vcstools installation in these notes for
# building instructions 

}}}


Then, go to the PFB replication repo (either [[~/documents/fine-pfb-reconstruction]] or [[~/work/pfb-testing]]), and do
{{{code: lang="sh" linenumbers="False"
# Go to the repo directory, make symbolic links to the theoretical impulse
# responses, and checkout the appropriate version
cd ~/documents/fine-pfb-reconstruction/test-data/fake_data
ln -s ~/documents/papers/ipfb/impulse_response_12.txt
ln -s ~/documents/papers/ipfb/impulse_response_Mirror.txt
# or
cd ~/work/pfb-testing/test-data/fake_data
ln -s ~/work/papers/ipfb/impulse_response_12.txt
ln -s ~/work/papers/ipfb/impulse_response_Mirror.txt

git checkout db53c3c

# Run the command
make compare_coarse_imp.eps

}}}

It is important that the scaling number given in the Makefile rule for fake_imp.raw matches the number in compare_coarse_imp.gpi:
**Makefile:**
{{{code: lang="makefile" linenumbers="False"
fake_imp.raw:
    ../../forward-pfb-model/generate_fake_raw 0 0 12800 12927 10.0 0 > $@
#                                                             ^^^^

}}}

compare_coarse_imp.gpi:
{{{code: lang="sh" linenumbers="False"
p 'impulse_response_12.txt' u ($0 - 11*128):(10*log10($1)) w l lc rgb "red" notitle, \
  'imp2' u ($1-12800):(dB($2/fact, $3/fact, 10.0)):(3) w l lc rgb "black" notitle
#                                           ^^^^

}}}


The result looks something like this:
{{{code: lang="sh" linenumbers="False"
gnuplot
load 'compare_coarse_imp.gpi'

}}}

{{./impulse_response_lsq12_01.png?width=640}}
This is very surprising because the previous tests done with noise data indicate that the "on-pulse" response is in the range -0.25 dB to -0.6 dB, instead of the ~-10 dB I'm seeing here.

Test to see if
