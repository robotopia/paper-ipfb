I've just finished writing a program (''generate_fake_raw'') that generates fake data in the .raw format. It has options to add a sine wave (user-specified frequency and amplitude), an impulse (user-specified time and amplitude), and noise (user-specified std dev).

Since I know the inverse PFB (as implemented in vcstools) does more or less the right thing, I can use easy-to-understand fake data to find out where my forward PFB model is going wrong.

{{{code: lang="sh" linenumbers="False"
> ../../forward-pfb-model/generate_fake_raw 0.0103 50.0 0 0 0 > fake_sin.raw
> ../../forward-pfb-model/generate_fake_raw 0 0 10000 100.0 0 > fake_imp.raw

> ../../forward-pfb-model/generate_fake_raw 0.0103 50.0 10000 100.0 12.0 > fake_all.raw
}}}


--------------------

I'm now trying to revamp my ''forward_pfb'' program so that it operates over a whole raw input file and outputs something resembling a recombined file. I may not finish this today, so I'll pick it up next week.
