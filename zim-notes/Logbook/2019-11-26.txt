Jake Jones just gave me a whole bunch of notes relating to how there is a quantisation step //before// the FFT stage of the PFB (see "Jake's pre-PFB notes" page), and I incorporated it into my own PFB (git commit a6f0f16), but I'm afraid it hasn't made too much of a difference. Compare this plot with the one shown in the 2019-11-24 entry:
