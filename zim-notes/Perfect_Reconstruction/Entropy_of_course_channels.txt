====== Entropy of course channels ======
Created Friday 04 September 2020

Each coarse channel sample is a (5+5)-bit complex integer whose value is a rounded value (assumed to be) drawn from a normal distribution with mean μ=0 and some variance σ². The probability mass function is therefore

(This assumes that the variance is small enough that the number of samples that would exceed the available bits is negligible.)
