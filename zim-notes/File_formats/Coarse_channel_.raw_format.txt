[From an email from Brian dated 22 June 2018:]

The following four files are the raw output of the centre fibre (ie middle eight channels) of both Rec01 and Rec09 for the two seconds discussed.

The packet headers have been removed and the 5+5i bit data has been changed to 8+8i.  The atomic unit is a int8_t  (equivalent to 'signed char' in most x86 GCC systems)

The file is effectively a four dimensional hypercube with dimensions (from slowest changing to fastest) being 'time step', 'coarse channel', 'Antenna', and finally 'real' or 'imaginary'

The files are 327,680,000 bytes in length.  This is equal to 1280000 * 8 * 16 * 2.

1280000 time steps being the number of time steps in a second in the MWA coarse channel data.

8 coarse channels, being channel numbers 8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16 in the MWA 0 to 23 channels number lists.

16 Antennas, being Rec14Y, Rec14X, Rec13Y, Rec13X, Rec12Y, Rec12X, Rec11Y, Rec11X, Rec18Y, Rec18X, Rec17Y, Rec17X, Rec16Y, Rec16X, Rec15Y, Rec15X

Real is first (index=0), followed by imaginary (index=1).

If you read the whole thing into a single dimension array, then a given value is at htr_data[time*256 + chan*32 + ant*2 + real];
