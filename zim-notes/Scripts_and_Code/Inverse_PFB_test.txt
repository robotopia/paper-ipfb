This page documents the correct chain of commands that were used to show how the PFB inversion code produces "correct" output.

===== Setting up =====

=== Install vcstools ===

See the page "vcstools installation".


=== Downloading the needed files ===

Make sure you have the recombined files (see "Logbook/2018-06-26"). The easiest way is probably:
{{{code: lang="sh" linenumbers="False"
galaxy> process vcs.py -m download -o 1213668624 -b 1213668800 -e 1213668801
}}}

and then, if necessary:
{{{code: lang="sh" linenumbers="False"
galaxy> process vcs.py -m recombine -o 1213668624 -b 1213668800 -e 1213668800
}}}

followed by downloading the files to your local machine. If the above doesn't automatically produce a metafilts file, then do:
{{{code: lang="sh" linenumbers="False"
> wget http://ws.mwatelescope.org/metadata/fits?obs_id=1213668624 -O metadata.fits
}}}
